### Errata
* **In Chapter 1, ‘Introducing the first game’ section.** This paragraph:

**"The controls will use the industry-standard WASD keyboard setup, where W moves forward, A and S move left and right, and D walks backward. Head movement is controlled using the mouse, and coins are collected by colliding with them.”**

_Should be changed/replaced to:_

**“The controls will use the industry-standard WASD keyboard setup, where W moves forward, A and D move left and right, and S walks backward. Head movement is controlled using the mouse, and coins are collected by colliding with them.”**

* **Page 132, "Adding Component" section:**
Please note that the Rotation around the X axis must also be frozen.

* **Pages 145 & 146, "Creating a Health component" section**:
Please note that the first letter of "Get" or "Set" should be small and not capital.
